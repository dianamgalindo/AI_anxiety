# Creative Making: Big Data, The Self and Social Platforms

This repository includes research, ideas, development, technical solutions and reflections around a specific project concerning Big Data.
This documentation should reflect how and why the data I have chosen is interesting to me. The project should include
a web-based experiment - a bot, a scraper, a dynamic website, or a experimental use of an API.
